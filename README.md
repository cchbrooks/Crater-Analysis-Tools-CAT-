**Disclaimer:**
  The current Python model codes are in an Alpha state. Further work is intended to improve detection capability and improve functionality of the model. If any bugs are found, please report them.

**Program required to run file:**
   - ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Online

**Files Required to Run:**
  - Crater Slope Detection Model: A Digital Terrain Model (DTM) or Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the region.
  - Diameter-Depth Calculator: A Digital Terrain Model (DTM) or Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the region and a polygon file of your identified craters.
  - External Slope & Internal Basin: Raster data file you wish to examine (such as geochemical) and a polygon file of your identified craters.

**Files Recommended:**
  - Photo-Imagery of the region you wish to investigate.

**Pre-Model Prep:**
  - We recommend creating a polygon clip file of the region you intend to investigate for your DTM/DEM. This will improve program speed and later clean up of detected features.
