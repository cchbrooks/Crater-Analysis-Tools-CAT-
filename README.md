**Disclaimer:**
  The current Python code is in an Alpha state. Further work is intended to improve detection capability and improve functionality of the model. This will get you a polygon file of detected craters and other terrain features. Human checking and cleanup of the data is required to separate features not required from intended targets

**Program required to run file:**
  ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Online

**Files Required to Run:**
  A Digitial Terrain Model (DTM) or Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the region.

**Files Recommended:**
  Photo-Imagery of the region you wish to investigate.


**Pre-Model Prep:**
  We recommend creating a polygon clip file of the region you intend to investigate for your DTM/DEM. This will improve program speed and later clean up of detected features.
